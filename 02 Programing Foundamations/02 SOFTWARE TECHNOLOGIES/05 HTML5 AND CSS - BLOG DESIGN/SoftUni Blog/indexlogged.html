                        <h2>Why the Right Storage Infrastructure Is So Critical for DBAs and IT Leaders</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>
                        I spend a lot of time talking with CIOs around the world,
                        on the infrastructure side of the house as well as the database/enterprise
                        app side of the house. I hear first-hand, from DBAs and IT infrastructure
                        teams alike, about the challenges they face with choosing the right
                        infrastructure for their database and enterprise app environments.
                        I consistently hear stories of the difficulties of meeting service-level agreements,
                        of meeting performance objectives, of providing continuous availability, availability
                        to recover quickly, of driving down TCO and leveraging the benefits of virtualization.
                        Customers tell me they want a virtual, open architecture that will allow them to
                        leverage best-in-class technologies, but are concerned about the performance impact this
                        may have on their production databases and applications.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At EMC World, I told you how EMC faced this challenge as we standardized our own
                        business-critical applications infrastructure that included Oracle, SAP, and Exchange.
                        Like many of our customers, our experience proved that virtual infrastructure can
                        achieve the standardization gains across IT while being able to maximize performance
                        for production applications and databases.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I provided specific examples of this in my keynote address. Just a small amount of flash
                        in virtualized Oracle databases in online transaction processing (OLTP) and Data
                        Warehouse workloads delivers extreme levels of performance.  How much? 3.7 million
                        random I/Os per second for Oracle OLTP environments at very low latencies and over
                        32 GB/second read scan performance with over 21 TB/hour data loads for Oracle data warehouses.
                        More importantly, this standardized approach of flash and virtualization makes a measurable impact
                        on long-term TCO.
