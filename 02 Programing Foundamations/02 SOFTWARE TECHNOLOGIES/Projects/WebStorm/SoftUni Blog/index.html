                    <h2>Why the Right Storage Infrastructure Is So Critical for DBAs and IT Leaders</h2>
                </header>
                <p>
                    I spend a lot of time talking with CIOs around the world,
                    on the infrastructure side of the house as well as the database/enterprise
                    app side of the house. I hear first-hand, from DBAs and IT infrastructure
                    teams alike, about the challenges they face with choosing the right
                    infrastructure for their database and enterprise app environments.
                    I consistently hear stories of the difficulties of meeting service-level agreements,
                    of meeting performance objectives, of providing continuous availability, availability
                    to recover quickly, of driving down TCO and leveraging the benefits of virtualization.
                    Customers tell me they want a virtual, open architecture that will allow them to
                    leverage best-in-class technologies, but are concerned about the performance impact this
                    may have on their production databases and applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At EMC World, I told you how EMC faced this challenge as we standardized our own
                    business-critical applications infrastructure that included Oracle, SAP, and Exchange.
                    Like many of our customers, our experience proved that virtual infrastructure can
                    achieve the standardization gains across IT while being able to maximize performance
                    for production applications and databases.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I provided specific examples of this in my keynote address. Just a small amount of flash
                    in virtualized Oracle databases in online transaction processing (OLTP) and Data
                    Warehouse workloads delivers extreme levels of performance.  How much? 3.7 million
                    random I/Os per second for Oracle OLTP environments at very low latencies and over
                    32 GB/second read scan performance with over 21 TB/hour data loads for Oracle data warehouses.
                    More importantly, this standardized approach of flash and virtualization makes a measurable impact
                    on long-term TCO.

                    <h2>New Release of the Dell EMC Ready Bundle for Red Hat OpenStack Platform</h2>
                </header>
                <p>
                    This week, we’re thinking about Red Hat, particularly as we are in Boston for the
                    Red Hat Summit (May 2-4) and the week after for the OpenStack Summit (May 8-11).
                    And we have some exciting news to share!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today we are announcing the next generation of the Dell EMC Ready Bundle for Red Hat
                    OpenStack Platform, a complete, proven and production-grade cloud platform jointly
                    engineered and validated by Dell EMC and Red Hat. This release features Red Hat OpenStack
                    Platform (OSP) 10, a massively-scalable and agile cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)
                    solution based on the upstream OpenStack ‘Newton’ release.
                </p>
                <h3>What’s New?</h3>
                <p>
                    This release delivers new and enhanced capabilities not only in features but also in
                    ordering, deployment, and support capabilities, as well.  Savvy readers may notice a
                    slight change to the solution name and release numbering.  Beginning now, we are aligning
                    the solution release numbering to that of Red Hat OpenStack Platform, for greater simplicity.
                    So what, then, is new in release 10?
